# Final Project: PHP and SQL 
This is a final project for the Cate School Advanced Computer Science class. 
This project was aimed at learning the basics of database querying and form handling. 

Exercise 3 and SQLExample were created by Mr. Ferguson. 
Fancy Form was a form created by me with guidance from Mr. Ferguson. 
Most of the work on SQL was done in the MySQL Workbench.
